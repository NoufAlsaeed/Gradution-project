# Gradution-project
The effect of plants has always been good for humans, and Islam has always urged us to plant. And as we know plants bring us positive energy and happiness, especially since it also resists environmental pollution and produces oxygen, and among the four most powerful projects under Saudi Vision 2030, the Green Riyadh project, which aims to plant and green Riyadh â€Ž[2].
Hence the idea of KHADRA project began, which is a marketplace Website that provides farmers and users with an integrated environment for buying and selling through a website, as it enables farmers to display their stores and add agricultural products such as agricultural tools, seeds, and plants, where the user can look for a shop or for a product that meets his requirements.
The marketplace website has a recommendation system that helps the user to choose the more favorable plants. Which makes this website contributes to give a stronger motivation to buy and cultivate, to participate in making our environment green, and to cultivate our homes, which will enable us to eat healthy organic products and bring positive energy.
After implementing the system, the website has gone through many tests using different methods which eventually came with great results.
